## ⚡ System Status
**Neon Kernel** is my personal portfolio and experimental sandbox. 
It showcases projects focused on **systems programming, performance, and low-level software design**.

I prioritize understanding how software behaves *at runtime*—memory constraints, execution context, and speed—rather than treating systems as black boxes.

> "Abstractions are earned, not assumed."

## 💎 Core Philosophy

| Directive | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance by Design** | Speed is a feature. Latency is the enemy. |
| **Control over Convenience** | Manual memory management teaches you more than a GC ever will. |
| **Transparency** | Understand the machine. Don't fear the segfault. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Engine)

- **Frontend:** `React` + `Framer Motion` (High-FPS animations)
- **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` (Utility-first for speed)
- **Backend / Systems:** `C++` `Python` `FastAPI`
- **Tooling:** `Arch Linux` `Neovim` `Git`

## 📡 Features (Modules)
- [x] **Project Grid:** Interactive modals with synthwave aesthetics.
- [x] **Terminal Interface:** CLI-style narrative and introspection for power users.
- [x] **Responsive:** Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile viewports.
- [ ] **Game Mode:** Hidden Godot minigame easter egg (Work In Progress).
