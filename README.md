## Overview

Memory Safe(ish) is my personal portfolio showcasing projects and experiments focused on **systems programming, performance, and low-level software design**.

I prioritize understanding how software behaves *at runtime* — memory, execution, and constraints — rather than treating systems as black boxes. This site reflects that philosophy through both its content and design.
